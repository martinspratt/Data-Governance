INFORMATION VALUE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK v2019.02 by Martin Spratt

First published 2012.

2019 04 15 - add Finnish version (draft) as a separate download.

Modern Value-First Data Governance Framework, eclipsing all known frameworks, whilst supporting RISK and COMPLIANCE.

It's simple. 
It's light. 
It's so simple, even a regulator or senior (non-IT) executive can understand it, support it, fund it, audit it, rate it.
It's free to use and create derivatives under Creative Commons v4.0.

Why is this Framework useful and different ?

1) Data Governance initiatives consistently fail due to the lack of commercial value creation 
2) Data Risk and Compliance have never built sustainable, funded reusable non-redundant Data Foundations (BASEL, GDPR, BCBS239 have all failed on this).
3) By our definition Data Governance "governs to value creation and extraction"
4) We don't ignore risks and compliance matters, but view these through the lens of "a ZERO cost by-product" of a good governance regime.
5) Most frameworks have no language or construct to manage a commercial overlay to the Data Governance regime.

Commercial Value creation is defined as:

a) Faster and easier data access (Operational Efficiency)
b) Data that is accurate, trustworthy and auditable by usage, by process, by persona, avoiding rework (Corporate Speed, Data Quality)
b) Monetization of data assets/files/gateways (selling/licensing) (New and increasing data revenue streams)
c) Improved customer experience (Innovation)
d) Faster and Richer Product/Offering development (Innovation) 
e) Enhanced brand value (Goodwill)
f) Intangible Asset Value (Balancesheet & Company Valuation Advantages)

Regulatory Compliance, Risk and other dominating obligations that deliver little to no commercial value uplift 
generally cause Data Goernance investments, regimes and intiatives to fail (or be rejectd by business sponsors)
within 12 months (or earlier).
